# UU2OOP-SFMLGraphPlotter
[UU Year 2 - Object-Oriented Programming] / Individual Assignment - SFML Graph Plotter Developed on Visual Studio using C++

Individual Project. Submitted as part of my Object-Oriented Programming class.

The purpse of the project was to develop a window application using SFML which plots the points of a file of values onto a graph. 
<br />The project could be taken further by presenting options to change the colour, and load in a different file of values, and by scaling the graph.

I received 86% for this assignment.

This is an window application.<br />
Developed on Visual Studio using SFML.<br />
